## About the Project

Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) assignment, assigned on 14 March, 2023
Use of Knuth–Morris–Pratt(KMP) and Brute-Force string matching algorithms on the given word puzzle.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | B | C | D | V | D |
| M | X | Y | J | K | A |
| J | Z | L | Y | O | M |
| L | P | R | O | S | E |
| N | D | S | P | U | R | 
| F | I | R | E | N | N |


We are required to search for a given word in this matrix.
The word could be present in a horizontal or vertical manner but not diagonally.

#### Implementation:
* Brute force: Two types of brute force pattern matching, horizontal and vertical done across each row and column of the matrix, respectively.
* Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm: Two types of KMP pattern matching, horizontal and vertical done across each row and column of the matrix, respectively.

> #### Implementation is done using Java

## Getting Started

### How to Run the Program [On Windows using Command Prompt or Power Shell]
> - Navigate to the location ```\src\main\java\```
> - Compile using the command: ```javac org\example\Main.java``` 
> - Class file _Main.class_ will be generated at the locaiton "org\example\"
> - Run the program using the command: ```java org.example.Main```
