Use of KMP and brute force string matching algorithm on the given word puzzle.

A B C D V D 
M X Y J K A 
J Z L Y O M 
L P R O S E 
N D S P U R 
F I R E N N 

We are required to search for a given word in this matrix.
The word could be present in a horizontal or vertical manner but not diagonally.

#### Implementation:
* Brute force: Two types of brute force pattern matching, horizontal and vertical done across each row and column of the matrix, respectively.
* Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm: Two types of KMP pattern matching, horizontal and vertical done across each row and column of the matrix, respectively.
